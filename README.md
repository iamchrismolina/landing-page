## How It's Made:

I first setup the html and its proper semantic elements to create a good sectioning of the page index. Which involves a Header, Hero, Main, and Footer. Although they have nesting of proper sub-sections where it fits, like header which contains the nav bar, the main which contains the product, testimony, & call-to-action, and etc. Classes are named which accordance to BEM naming convention for easy readability and a modern approach to css organization.

Each CSS's selector styling properties are divided into categories namely:
Layout, Typography, Colors, Borders, & Animations which is useful for easily navigating the stylesheet for future renditions.

**Tech used**: HTML and CSS

## Optimizations

Javascript can be added to include some functionalities of your desire and Frameworks could potentially be added to make it more modern. Also, for what it's worth vanilla technologies will do with it.

## Lessons Learned:

Semantic HTML naming designation

- which helps with SEO as search engines such as google, bing, etc will now be easily able to distinguish which section is which within the website.
- Sectioning also helps with future developers to help easily navigate parts of the page and determine where information fits within the page
  CSS naming convention (BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS)
- I learned about organizing my css and use a OOCSS, SMACSS, and BEM to take advantage of the modern approach to organizing css and readability and clarity
- Anti-patterns such as using !important & IDs are intentionally avoided so as not to get in conflict and become claustrophobic and selectors becoming deeply inheriting
